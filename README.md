# RZSG
Robust Zero-Sum Gaming method for active learning. The matlab code only for binary classification case in shallow learning. These are just demo codes for implementation. 

Run demo.m for experiments after putting your training and testing data under data folder. e.g. demo('german', 5, 20, 5)

The proposed algorithm is implemented in RZSG.m.
